O: I have learnt TDD combining with OOP today. We also finished a practice on parking lot management program today. 
We experienced tasking, preparing test cases and then implementing. We also tried the process of iteration today.
(iterate from single parkingLot class to parkingLot class + parking boy class to parkingLot class + different parking boy classes) 

R: I found TDD is inherently coherent with OOP(i.e., preparing more test cases can lead us to think more about the nature and functions
of different objects). Thus, using TDD in development for OOP would effectively enhance 
code quality and reliability. 

I: I think TDD is a powerful tool for helping me to learn and execute OOP behaviour.

D: I will combine TDD with OOP for my development tasks and communicating with colleagues in the future.
